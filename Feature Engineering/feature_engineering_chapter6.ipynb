        "- Dimensionality reduction is about getting rid of \"uninformative information\" while retaining the crucial bits.\n",
        "- PCA focuses on the notion of linear dependency.\n",
        "- If the column space is small compared to the total number of features, then most\n",
        "of the features are linear combinations of a few key features.\n",
        "- Linearly dependent\n",
        "features are a waste of space and computation power because the information\n",
        "could have been encoded in much fewer features.\n",
        "- The key idea is to replace redundant features with a few new featuers that adequately summarize information contained in the original feature space.\n",
        "- The new data blob should retain as much of the original volume as possible.\n",
        "- Mathematically, it translates into maximizing the variance of the data points in the new feature space."
